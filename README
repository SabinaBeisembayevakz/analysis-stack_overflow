Installations

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
The libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn


Project Motivation

I took data from stack overflow survey 2022 and analyzed it to answer 3 questions:
1. What course platforms do professional developers choose to get certified in coding and does it change with level of experience?
2. What course platforms do people from other categories (people who are learning to code, code as hobby, developers at past or for whom coding is part of their work) choose to get certified?
3. How developers buy new tools?
I was very curious where do other developers learn coding, because right now i am myself learning to code better and I think its nice to know how other developers do it, and this information will be helpful to people (hopefully), who as well are on their learning journey.
