This is my 1st data science project

I took data from stack overflow survey 2022 and analyzed it to answer 3 questions:

1. What course platforms do professional developers choose to get certified in coding and does it change with level of experience?
2. What course platforms do people from other categories (people who are learning to code, code as hobby, developers at past or for whom coding is part of their work) choose to get certified?
3. How developers buy new tools?

I was very curious where do other developers learn coding, because right now i am myself learning to code better and I think its nice to know how other developers do it, and this information will be helpful to people (hopefully), who as well are on their learning journey.

The results:

* People choose cheaper options for online coding courses, like Udemy, Coursera, Codeacademy and etc.
* Pluralsight becomes popular choice for developers with more years of experience
* Data scientists and machine learning engineers choose more academic courses, thus Coursera is the top choice for them.
* Professional developers usually start free trial, ask other developers they know or visit communities like Stack Overflow to make decisions about buying new tools.

Code includes data preparation and data visualization. 


The libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn

I included 
* Dataset: survey_results_public.csv file 
* The Code file is the jupyter notebook script
