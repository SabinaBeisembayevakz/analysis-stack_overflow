This is my 1st data science project

I took data from stack overflow survey 2022 and analyzed it to answer 3 questions:

1. What course platforms do professional developers choose to get certified in coding and does it change with level of experience?
2. What course platforms do people from other categories (people who are learning to code, code as hobby, developers at past or for whom coding is part of their work) choose to get certified?
3. How developers buy new tools?


Code includes data preparation and data visualization.
